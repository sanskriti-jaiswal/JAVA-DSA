# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my personal DSA journey! This repository is where I regularly push my solutions and explorations across core **Data Structures and Algorithms**, written in **Java**. Each folder reflects my learning, debugging, and problem-solving process — organized, version-controlled, and continuously evolving. This repository contains my ongoing practice and implementation of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. It covers a wide range of topics from basic arrays to advanced concepts like trees, recursion, OOPs, and more — all organized by topic for easy reference.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I'm **Sanskriti Jaiswal**, and this repo is a reflection of my **daily commitment to mastering problem-solving** and writing clean, efficient Java code. Whether I’m debugging a tricky recursion bug or simulating a queue operation, I push every learning step here.

It’s more than just code — it’s a **chronicle of growth**, pattern recognition, and consistency. This also helps me revisit concepts quickly and track how I’ve improved over time.
